  <li>When encumbered you may now still move, but at double the standard AP cost.</li>
  <li>
    Significantly increased both the health of all buildings, and the amount of health recovered when repairing
    a building. This effect scales up with building complexity – more “modern” buildings received a much larger buff
    than the simplest huts. Totems received the largest buff.
  </li>
  <li>Totems can now be targeted without destroying other buildings in the settlement first – keep them repaired!</li>
  <li>
    Buildings withing the boundaries of a settlement are now protected by settlement members standing on that tile.
    Attackers cannot attack a building where non-provisional, non-dazed members of the settlement are standing
    (outside) on the same tile as the targeted building. In other words: guard duty time!
  </li>
  <li>
    You can now also guard stockpiles. If a non-dazed settlement member is standing on the stockpile,
    non-settlement-members may not withdraw items.
    If the stockpile is unguarded it continues to be able to be freely accessed by all.
