    <b>Buttercup</b> has decided to
    <a href="http://shintolin.forumcircle.com/viewtopic.php?p=21189#21189" rel="external">shut down Shintolin</a>.
    In response, <b>Ecce</b> (also known as <b>Deschain</b>) is now hosting the game at <kbd>www.shintolin.com</kbd>
    rather than the old domain of <kbd>shintolin.co.uk</kbd>. As part of this move (which includes an entirely new
    codebase built from scratch), all player accounts have been wiped.

  <li>The **Contacts** feature has been removed.</li>
  <li>Added the ability to <b>change your email address and password</b> to the profile screen.</li>
