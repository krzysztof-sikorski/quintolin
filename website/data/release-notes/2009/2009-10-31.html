<p>A number of bugs were fixed, namely:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Small buildings can now be constructed on dirt and forest tiles.</li>
  <li>Filling pots now costs AP, rather than giving it.</li>
  <li>Pots are not used up when baking bread, but are used up when making pots of flour.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Absolutely nothing</b> else was changed today.</p>
