    First pass of a <b>new combat balance</b>! Hit chances have gone way up! Damage has gone up!
    The improvement paths of the various weapon types now have some diversity!
    The world of <code>Shintolin</code> just got a bit more exciting… and <u>dangerous</u>.
  </li>
  <li>
    You may now <b>vote</b> for the leader of your settlement from anywhere via the settlement’s profile page.
    Additionally, settlement leaders may <b>promote/evict</b> provisional members from the settlement profile
    from anywhere as well.
  </li>
  <li>Settlements may now <b>customize the titles</b> of their provisional members and full members.</li>
  <li>
    We’ve done a pass on <b>farming fields</b> to ensure all of the functionality works as expected.
    The mechanics are still quite similar to the classic version of Shintolin, but with yields being more predictable
    (<code>+3</code> growth/night, an addition <code>+6</code> growth/night if watered).
    An <u>optimal</u> year will produce a <b>net</b> gain of 79 wheat per field.
  </li>
  <li>
    Dropped items now have a chance to be <b>permanently removed from the game</b> each night
    they remain on the ground. This <u>does not apply</u> to items dropped/given to buildings
    that support the give/take mechanic (example: Stockpiles).
  </li>
