<li>Fixed a bug preventing characters from attacking buildings within their own settlement. Hat tip to Grixic and Juraz.</li>
<li>Fixed bug preventing provisional settlement members from being kicked when dazed. Hat tip to Clary.</li>
<li>Moved the “Kick to Outside” action to the Building tab.</li>
<li>Added new action to allow settlement leader to kick any dazed player from their settlement. This action is only available at the totem pole.</li>

<li>Have shut down our (quite inactive) forums in favor of an official subreddit: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220117001426/https://www.reddit.com/r/Shintolin/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Shintolin/</a></li>

<li>When encumbered you may now still move, but at double the standard AP cost.</li>
<li>Significantly increased both the health of all buildings and the amount of health recovered when repairing a building. This effect scales up with building complexity – more “modern” buildings received a much larger buff than the simplest huts. Totems received the largest buff.</li>
<li>Totems can now be targeted without destroying other buildings in the settlement first – keep them repaired!</li>
<li>Buildings withing the boundaries of a settlement are now protected by settlement members standing on that tile. Attackers cannot attack a building where non-provisional, non-dazed members of the settlement are standing (outside) on the same tile as the targeted building. In other words: guard duty time!</li>
<li>You can now also guard stockpiles. If a non-dazed settlement member is standing on the stockpile, non-settlement-members may not withdraw items. If the stockpile is unguarded it continues to be able to be freely accessed by all.</li>
<li>FIX: will no longer see recipes you can’t use (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220117001426/https://shintolin.slack.com/archives/general/p1462097829000007">https://shintolin.slack.com/archives/general/p1462097829000007</a>)</li>

<li>Settlements may once again build a <code>Hunter&#39;s Shrine</code>! Members of the settlement may then sacrifice certain goods (<code>mammoth tusks</code> only for now) to gain <code>Favor</code> for their settlement. This favor is shown on a new <code>Favored Settlements</code> leaderboard. There will be more uses for <code>Favor</code> in the future – stay tuned…</li>
<li>You may now use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220117001426/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> formatting in your character or settlement’s profile.</li>
<li>BUG FIX: Inactive+Dazed players no longer count toward maximum occupancy (as they don’t show up on the map and thus cannot be kicked out). Hat tip to @Juraz.</li>
<li>BUG FIX: Maximum Occupancy wasn’t actually being taken into account during the AP recovery calculation yet! Whoops!</li>

<li>You may now revive yourself at a high AP cost after you have been dazed for at least 24 hours. Note that you may not revive yourself while within a settlement other than your own (but may do so from within unsettled lands.</li>
<li>Significant buff to Medicine &amp; Hospitaller skills; also significant buffs to Herbal Poultices and Herbal Teas.</li>
<li>Added a new badge! The “Bug Hunter” badge grants the “YOUR NAME the Immaculate” title for players who have helped track down significant (or copious) bugs.</li>
<li>Fixed bug that was preventing players from hunting animals.</li>
<li>Fixed the AP cost of repairing buildings – it was incorrectly charging you twice as much AP as intended.</li>
<li>Fixed display bug that incorrectly showed your own weapon as having broken when another player attacks a building in your settlement.</li>

<li>Migrated our database to the latest version of the server software, which should provide a big performance boost. Unfortunately it is also likely to have caused a few bugs that I have yet to catch. Keep me informed in Slack, please.</li>
<li>Shintolin is now an island!</li>
<li>You now take periodic damage if you remain in water for too long. Learning the <em>swimming</em> skill will prevent you from taking this damage in shallow water, but nobody can swim in deep water for long.</li>
<li>You no longer see inactive dazed players on the map!</li>
<li>Fixed bug that prevented players from kicking dazed players out of a building’s interior.</li>
<li>Fixed bug that prevented certain settlements from being destroyed (if a Ruins or Cave was found nearby.)</li>
<li>Fixed bug that was preventing elections from proceeding as expected.</li>
<li>Fixed bug that allowed dazed players to revive themselves at any settlement building. It must now be from within a hospital.</li>
<li>Properly displaying destroyed settlements as destroyed in the leaderboards. Removed destroyed settlements from the list of most populated settlements.</li>

<li>You can now more easily see which crafting &amp; building recipes are available to you.</li>
<li>Ivory weapons now require the Carving skill to craft.</li>
<li>Skills you cannot purchase are hidden by default. A button at the bottom of the page will let you see the complete tree.</li>
<li>Campfires have received a <strong>significant</strong> buff.</li>
<li>Stockpiles now require the <code>Trailblazing</code> skill to build and repair.</li>
<li>Kilns now require the <code>Masonry</code> skill to build and repair.</li>
<li>Digging now requires the <code>Foraging</code> skill and a <code>Spade</code> (instead of a <code>Digging Stick</code>). Crafting a <code>Spade</code> requires the <code>Carpentry</code> skill.</li>
<li>Building a field now requires a <code>Hoe</code> (instead of a <code>Digging Stick</code>). Crafting a <code>Hoe</code> requires the <code>Carpentry</code> skill.</li>
<li>Building a trail now requires a <code>Hand Axe</code> instead of a <code>Digging Stick</code>.</li>
<li><code>Digging Sticks</code> are no longer craftable.</li>

<li>First pass of a <strong>new combat balance</strong>! Hit chances have gone way up! Damage has gone up! The improvement paths of the various weapon types now have some diversity! The world of <code>Shintolin</code> just got a bit more exciting… and <em>dangerous</em>.</li>
<li>You may now <strong>vote</strong> for the leader of your settlement from anywhere via the settlement’s profile page. Additionally, settlement leaders may <strong>promote/evict</strong> provisional members from the settlement profile from anywhere as well.</li>
<li>Settlements may now <strong>customize the titles</strong> of their provisional members and full members.</li>
<li>We’ve done a pass on <strong>farming fields</strong> to ensure all of the functionality works as expected. The mechanics are still quite similar to the classic version of Shintolin, but with yields being more predictable (<code>+3</code> growth/night, an addition <code>+6</code> growth/night if watered). An <em>optimal</em> year will produce a <strong>net</strong> gain of 79 wheat per field.</li>
<li>Dropped items now have a chance to be <strong>permanently removed from the game</strong> each night they remain on the ground. This <em>does not apply</em> to items dropped/given to buildings that support the give/take mechanic (example: Stockpiles).</li>
</ul>

<li>You may now <em>revive yourself</em> in a <strong>Hospital</strong> at a cost of 24 AP. (This only works if you belong to the same settlement as the <strong>Hospital</strong>.)</li>
<li>While dazed your AP regenerates at <em>1 AP per hour</em>. This increases to 2 AP per hour if you are inside a <strong>Hospital</strong>.</li>
<li>Other than a few exceptions (huts, caves, ruins) most buildings require you to be a <strong>member of their settlement</strong> to get their AP recovery buff.</li>
<li>Players with the <em>Medicine</em> skill receive an AP recovery buff while inside <strong>Hospitals</strong> as if they were in a <strong>Longhouse</strong>.</li>
<li>You can now see which players are dazed on their profile screen or on the leaderboards.</li>
<li>Badges &amp; titles! Players who joined during the first couple of weeks (before July 17, 2015) have received the <strong>Beta Tester</strong> badge, when confers the <code>of the Vanguard</code> title. Expect to see more badges/titles in the future.</li>
<li>Simplified the process of upgrading buildings.</li>
<li>Reviving a player does not take immediate effect. Using an herbal poultice on a dazed player allows that player to revive themselves for 0 AP and without the need for a hospital.</li>

<li><strong>Hunger</strong> has been revamped! First, hunger now “counts up” instead of down. In other words, high hunger bad, low hunger good. Also hunger no longer decreases your HP or maximum HP when starving. Instead hunger now progressively diminishes your AP regeneration. Time to start farming!</li>
<li>You can now chat from the <strong>mobile friendly chat page</strong>. Its a great way to stay connected while on-the-go. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220117001426/https://www.shintolin.com/game/chat">Give it a try</a>!</li>

<li>A <strong>chat box</strong> was added.</li>

<li>Kids these days don’t now what it was like to wander the wilderness, they didn’t have none of this “civilisation” when I were a lad. <strong>New players</strong> may choose to start in an existing settlement.</li>

<li>A wandering tribe has settled by a large body of water, which they have named <strong>Hermit Lake</strong>. There seems to be a different distribution of <strong>plant life</strong> in that region; some items are more common, some are less so.</li>
<li>To allow villages more control over their resources, players that enter a square containing a <strong>stockpile</strong> can see all items that were added and removed within the past 24 hours. <strong>Buildings</strong> can now only hold a limited number of users.</li>

<li>Shintolin astronomers are reporting that the pace of life has changed; the <strong>years</strong> now pass a rate of one every twelve real life days.</li>
<li><strong>Inactive players</strong> now dissapear from the map after 5 days. Their accounts are not deleted and their characters reappear when they log back in.</li>
<li>In response to player feedback, players’ actions are less limited when <strong>dazed</strong>; they can now search, give items, trade, and use non-revive items. To balance this, they now regain AP at a much slower rate until they are revived.</li>
<li><strong>New players</strong> begin the game with three days’ worth of food - however, they can only eat it while they remain at level one.</li>

<li><strong>Farming</strong> has been implemented. Iis has arrived at Eudaimonia’s totem pole, bringing supplies of <strong>wheat</strong> to trade.</li>
<li>Crop cycles are effected by <strong>seasons</strong>, as are search rates and location descriptions. Currently, one season is equal to one real world day - this is temporary, to iron out any bugs in the system. It will increase to one season every three or four days at some stage.</li>

<li>Longhouses can now be converted into <strong>workshops</strong>, which allow certain items to be crafted for a lower AP cost, or <strong>hospitals</strong>, where healing items are more effective. However, doing this removes the AP restoration benefits of the longhouse.</li>
<li>Players now cook the pieces of <strong>raw meat</strong> in their inventory all at once, rather than one by one. The AP cost is fixed, regardless of how much meat is cooked.</li>

<li><strong>New players</strong> now begin in a random location. Gaining <strong>new skills</strong> only increases the XP cost for skills of the same type.</li>

<li>Animals now keep to the forests, and some will <strong>retaliate</strong> if attacked. <strong>Campfires</strong> burn more slowly, and their fuel levels can be seen.</li>
<li>The XP cost of <strong>new skills</strong> increases as one levels up. <strong>Chopping down trees</strong> now gives Wanderer XP; the AP cost can be reduced by purchasing the <strong>Lumberjack</strong> skill.</li>
