    Migrated our database to the latest version of the server software, which should provide a big performance boost.
    Unfortunately it is also likely to have caused a few bugs that I have yet to catch.
    Keep me informed in Slack, please.

  <li>Shintolin is now an island!</li>
  <li>
    You now take periodic damage if you remain in water for too long.
    Learning the <u>swimming</u> skill will prevent you from taking this damage in shallow water,
    but nobody can swim in deep water for long.
  </li>
  <li>You no longer see inactive dazed players on the map!</li>
  <li>Fixed bug that prevented players from kicking dazed players out of a building's interior.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug that prevented certain settlements from being destroyed (if a Ruins or Cave was found nearby.)</li>
  <li>Fixed bug that was preventing elections from proceeding as expected.</li>
  <li>
    Fixed bug that allowed dazed players to revive themselves at any settlement building.
    It must now be from within a hospital.
  </li>
  <li>
    Properly displaying destroyed settlements as destroyed in the leaderboards.
    Removed destroyed settlements from the list of most populated settlements.
