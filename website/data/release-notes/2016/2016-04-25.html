    Settlements may once again build a <code>Hunter's Shrine</code>!
    Members of the settlement may then sacrifice certain goods (<code>mammoth tusks</code> only for now)
    to gain <code>Favor</code> for their settlement. This favor is shown on a new <code>Favored Settlements</code>
    leaderboard. There will be more uses for <code>Favor</code> in the future – stay tuned…

    in your character or settlement’s profile.

    BUG FIX: Maximum Occupancy wasn’t actually being taken into account during the AP recovery calculation yet! Whoops!
