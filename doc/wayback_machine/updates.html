<li>Fixed a bug preventing characters from attacking buildings within their own settlement. Hat tip to Grixic and Juraz.</li>
<li>Fixed bug preventing provisional settlement members from being kicked when dazed. Hat tip to Clary.</li>
<li>Moved the “Kick to Outside” action to the Building tab.</li>
<li>Added new action to allow settlement leader to kick any dazed player
 from their settlement. This action is only available at the totem pole.</li>

<li>When encumbered you may now still move, but at double the standard AP cost.</li>
<li>Significantly increased both the health of all buildings and the
amount of health recovered when repairing a building. This effect scales
 up with building complexity – more “modern” buildings received a much
larger buff than the simplest huts. Totems received the largest buff.</li>
<li>Totems can now be targeted without destroying other buildings in the settlement first – keep them repaired!</li>
<li>Buildings withing the boundaries of a settlement are now protected
by settlement members standing on that tile. Attackers cannot attack a
building where non-provisional, non-dazed members of the settlement are
standing (outside) on the same tile as the targeted building. In other
words: guard duty time!</li>
<li>You can now also guard stockpiles. If a non-dazed settlement member
is standing on the stockpile, non-settlement-members may not withdraw
items. If the stockpile is unguarded it continues to be able to be
freely accessed by all.</li>

<li>Settlements may once again build a <code>Hunter's Shrine</code>! Members of the settlement may then sacrifice certain goods (<code>mammoth tusks</code> only for now) to gain <code>Favor</code> for their settlement.

<li>BUG FIX: Inactive+Dazed players no longer count toward maximum
occupancy (as they don’t show up on the map and thus cannot be kicked
out). Hat tip to @Juraz.</li>

<li>Significant buff to Medicine &amp; Hospitaller skills; also significant buffs to Herbal Poultices and Herbal Teas.</li>
<li>Added a new badge! The “Bug Hunter” badge grants the “YOUR NAME the

<li>Migrated our database to the latest version of the server software,
which should provide a big performance boost. Unfortunately it is also
likely to have caused a few bugs that I have yet to catch. Keep me
informed in Slack, please.</li>
<li>Shintolin is now an island!</li>
<li>You now take periodic damage if you remain in water for too long. Learning the <em>swimming</em> skill will prevent you from taking this damage in shallow water, but nobody can swim in deep water for long.</li>
<li>You no longer see inactive dazed players on the map!</li>
<li>Fixed bug that prevented players from kicking dazed players out of a building’s interior.</li>
<li>Fixed bug that prevented certain settlements from being destroyed (if a Ruins or Cave was found nearby.)</li>

<li>First pass of a <strong>new combat balance</strong>! Hit chances
have gone way up! Damage has gone up! The improvement paths of the
various weapon types now have some diversity! The world of <code>Shintolin</code> just got a bit more exciting… and <em>dangerous</em>.</li>
<li>You may now <strong>vote</strong> for the leader of your settlement from anywhere via the settlement’s profile page. Additionally, settlement leaders may <strong>promote/evict</strong> provisional members from the settlement profile from anywhere as well.</li>
<li>Settlements may now <strong>customize the titles</strong> of their provisional members and full members.</li>
<li>We’ve done a pass on <strong>farming fields</strong> to ensure all
of the functionality works as expected. The mechanics are still quite
similar to the classic version of Shintolin, but with yields being more
predictable (<code>+3</code> growth/night, an addition <code>+6</code> growth/night if watered). An <em>optimal</em> year will produce a <strong>net</strong> gain of 79 wheat per field.</li>
<li>Dropped items now have a chance to be <strong>permanently removed from the game</strong> each night they remain on the ground. This <em>does not apply</em> to items dropped/given to buildings that support the give/take mechanic (example: Stockpiles).</li>

<li>You may now <em>revive yourself</em> in a <strong>Hospital</strong> at a cost of 24 AP. (This only works if you belong to the same settlement as the <strong>Hospital</strong>.)</li>
<li>While dazed your AP regenerates at <em>1 AP per hour</em>. This increases to 2 AP per hour if you are inside a <strong>Hospital</strong>.</li>
<li>Other than a few exceptions (huts, caves, ruins) most buildings require you to be a <strong>member of their settlement</strong> to get their AP recovery buff.</li>
<li>Players with the <em>Medicine</em> skill receive an AP recovery buff while inside <strong>Hospitals</strong> as if they were in a <strong>Longhouse</strong>.</li>
<li>You can now see which players are dazed on their profile screen or on the leaderboards.</li>
<li>Badges &amp; titles! Players who joined during the first couple of weeks (before July 17, 2015) have received the <strong>Beta Tester</strong> badge, when confers the <code>of the Vanguard</code> title. Expect to see more badges/titles in the future.</li>
<li>Simplified the process of upgrading buildings.</li>
<li>Reviving a player does not take immediate effect. Using an herbal
poultice on a dazed player allows that player to revive themselves for 0
 AP and without the need for a hospital.</li>
<li>Longhouses now only grant a +0.5 AP regen (Cottages continue to
grant +1 AP regen), but the maximum capacity for longhouses (and
hospitals) has been increased to 8</li>

<li><strong>Stockpiles</strong> can once again be built outside of settlements. Rejoice!</li>
<li><strong>Huts</strong> now require the <strong>construction skill</strong> to be built (the skill text has always suggested this was required.)</li>
<li><strong>Huts</strong> are now considered <em>tiny</em> and can be built in a greater variety of locations.</li>

 up” instead of down. In other words, high hunger bad, low hunger good.
Also hunger no longer decreases your HP or maximum HP when starving.

<li>Longhouses can now be converted into <strong>workshops</strong>, which allow certain items to be crafted for a lower AP cost, or <strong>hospitals</strong>, where healing items are more effective. However, doing this removes the AP restoration benefits of the longhouse.</li>
<li>Players now cook the pieces of <strong>raw meat</strong> in their inventory all at once, rather than one by one. The AP cost is fixed, regardless of how much meat is cooked.</li>
