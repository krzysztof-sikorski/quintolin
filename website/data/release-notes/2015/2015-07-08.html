    A <b>new chat system</b> has been deployed! There is a new visual design for the message entry area.
    In addition to that [Shout] is now restricted in its range once again (15 tile radius).
    To facilitate cross-community discussion, a new [OOC] option has been added that sends a message to every
    <u>active</u> player (performed an action within the past 24 hours) regardless of where they are on the map.
    Finally, you can now [Emote]. Enjoy!
