  Shintoli astronomers are reporting that the pace of life has changed;
  the <b>years</b> now pass a rate of one every twelve real life days.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Inactive players</b> now dissapear from the map after 5 days.
  Their accounts are not deleted and their characters reappear when they log back in.

  In response to player feedback, players' actions are less limited when <b>dazed</b>;
  they can now search, give items, trade, and use non-revive items.
  To balance this, they now regain AP at a much slower rate until they are revived.

  <b>New players</b> begin the game with three days' worth of food
  - however, they can only eat it while they remain at level one.
