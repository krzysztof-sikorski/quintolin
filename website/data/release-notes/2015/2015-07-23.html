  <li>
    You may now <u>revive yourself</u> in a <b>Hospital</b> at a cost of 24 AP.
    (This only works if you belong to the same settlement as the <b>Hospital</b>.)
  </li>
  <li>
    While dazed your AP regenerates at <u>1 AP per hour</u>.
    This increases to 2 AP per hour if you are inside a <b>Hospital</b>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Other than a few exceptions (huts, caves, ruins) most buildings require you
    to be a <b>member of their settlement</b> to get their AP recovery buff.
  </li>
  <li>
    Players with the <u>Medicine</u> skill receive an AP recovery buff while inside <b>Hospitals</b>
    as if they were in a <b>Longhouse</b>.
  </li>
  <li>You can now see which players are dazed on their profile screen or on the leaderboards.</li>
  <li>
    Badges & titles! Players who joined during the first couple of weeks (before July 17, 2015)
    have received the <b>Beta Tester</b> badge, when confers the <code>of the Vanguard</code> title.
    Expect to see more badges/titles in the future.
  </li>
  <li>Simplified the process of upgrading buildings.</li>
  <li>
    Reviving a player does not take immediate effect. Using a herbal poultice on a dazed player
    allows that player to revive themselves for 0 AP and without the need for a hospital.
  </li>
  <li>
    Longhouses now only grant a +0.5 AP regen (Cottages continue to grant +1 AP regen),
    but the maximum capacity for longhouses (and hospitals) has been increased to 8.
