<p>Settlements are being put under tighter control:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Leaders can now <b>oust</b> dazed members if they so choose.</li>
  <li>Newcomers must <b>prove their worth</b> by <b>surviving</b> a full day before they are considered citizens.</li>
  <li>
    Non-residents and newcomers <b>cannot perform revives</b> within a settlementâ€™s boundaries,
    though citizens may revive <u>them</u>.
  </li>
  <li>The starving must now be <b>fed</b> before they can be <b>revived</b> from their daze.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Profile</b> and <b>settlement images</b> are resized to a maximum of <b>300 X 300</b> pixels,
    instead of being made exactly 300 pixels wide.
  </li>
</ul>
