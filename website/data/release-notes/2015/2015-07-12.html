    <b>Hunger</b> has been revamped! First, hunger now “counts up” instead of down.
    In other words, high hunger bad, low hunger good.
    Also hunger no longer decreases your HP or maximum HP when starving.
    Instead, hunger now progressively diminishes your AP regeneration. Time to start farming!

    You can now <kbd>/whisper</kbd> to players <b>anywhere on the map</b>. Realistic? No… but I couldn't stop you
    from talking to each other 1:1 <u>outside</u> the game anyway, so I’d rather embrace it!
