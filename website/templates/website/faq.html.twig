        <h2>Gameplay</h2>

        <h3>Is there a tutorial?</h3>
        <p>
          <del>
            There is currently a guide for new players on the
            <a href="https://shintolin.fandom.com/wiki/New_Player_Guide" rel="external">wiki</a>, and another on the
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150224004720/http://shintolin.forumcircle.com/viewtopic.php?t=107"
               rel="external">forums</a> – there’s also a section on the forum for beginner questions.
          </del>
        </p>
        <p>
          <del>I plan to add a short in-game tutorial at some point.</del>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>NOTE:</strong> These links are old and may contain incorrect information.
          There is no “fresh”, up-to-date tutorial available.
        </p>

        <h3>What is AP?</h3>
        <p>
          AP are action points, and represent your character’s limited time and energy.
          Most actions in Shintolin cost AP; when your AP drops below 0, you must rest before you can do anything else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Action points are automatically restored every hour.
          If you rest inside a building or by a campfire, you’ll recover AP more quickly.
        </p>

        <h3>How does hunger work?</h3>
        <p>
          You lose 1 hunger point every 8 hours – eating one food item restores 1 hunger point. If your hunger hits 0,
          you will slowly lose HP. Your character will automatically eat if they have food in their possession,
          so keep stocked up, and you’ll be OK.
        </p>

        <h3>What’s the point of the game?</h3>
        <p>
          If you’ve just signed up, you should probably try to find a source of food, though your supply of noobcakes
          will keep you fed for the first few days if you want to explore. Gaining XP, so you can buy skills
          and level up is a good idea. Much of the action in Shintolin takes place in settlements,
          so joining one might give you both assistance and things to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shintolin is open-ended, and players can decide their own goals. Once you’ve found your feet, you could try
          to earn a living by hunting, farming, crafting or trading, get involved with settlement life and politics,
          gather some followers to found your own village, embark on a war of conquest, or try something else entirely.
          It’s up to you.
        </p>

        <h3>I searched and didn't find anything…</h3>
        <p>
          Searching isn’t successful every time, so you might need to try searching a few times
          before you find anything. If you’re still not finding much, keep the following in mind:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Search rates are variable. If a lot of people have searched a square recently, it’ll be harder
            to find things. Try seeing if you have better luck searching away from densely populated areas
            – or buy the Foraging skill, which lets you see the resource level of a square.
          </li>
          <li>
            Search rates vary by a season. You won’t find very much food in winter
            – it’s worth stocking up during Spring and Summer.
          </li>
          <li>Some squares don't have anything to find. This includes dirt, fields, and wilderness tiles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>I'm dazed! What can I do?</h3>
        <p>
          When your HP drops to 0, whether by injury, starvation or something else, you become dazed.
          Your actions are limited, and you recover AP more slowly; another player must revive you
          with a herbal poultice or herbal tea (you can't revive yourself).
        </p>
        <p>
          Your best bet for revival is to find a settlement with a hospital; failing that, finding a large group
          of people will give you a better chance of being healed than staying in the countryside.
          Try offering items for someone to revive you, and be sure to actually ask other players for revival.
        </p>

        <h3>Why did everyone in town X attack me?</h3>
        <p>
          That depends on them; maybe they didn't like you taking items from their stockpile,
          maybe they didn't like you chopping down their trees, maybe they just don't like strangers.
          Try another village, you might find a better welcome.
        </p>

        <h3>Am I allowed to register multiple accounts?</h3>
        <p>
          <del>
            To explore the different options in the world of Shintolin, you are currently allowed to register
            up to 3 accounts, however there are certain rules. You must keep your characters separate
            (at least 10 tiles apart). They must live separate lives, and not assist each other in any way.
            Registering multiple characters to achieve your goals is known as “zerging” or “alt abuse”,
            and is against the spirit of the game. Shintolin is about collaborating with other people,
            not a “who-can-register-the-most-throwaway-accounts” contest.
          </del>
        </p>
        <p>
          <del>
            Actions considered alt abuse include having characters that reside in the same settlement,
            characters trading items with each other, characters ganging up to attack another character or animal,
            and one character leaving items in a stockpile for another to pick up. This isn't an exhaustive list.
          </del>
        </p>
        <p>
          <del>
            There is currently a 330-hit IP limit to prevent you registering more than 3 accounts.
            I plan to add more advanced features to prevent alt abuse,
            though thankfully it isn't much of an issue at the moment.
          </del>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>NOTE:</strong> These technical limitations are not yet implemented in the current version of the game,
          although you are still encouraged to follow the spirit of the game and do not register too many accounts.
        </p>

        <h3>Is there anything to find in the wilderness?</h3>
        <p>No.</p>

        <h2>Development</h2>

        <h3>Who made Shintolin?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The original game (versions 1 &amp; 2) was created by <b>Isaac Lewis</b> (homepage:
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909093322/http://i.saac.me/" rel="external">http://i.saac.me/</a>
            ).
          </li>
          <li>
            Maintenance and active development of version 2 was later ceded to two Shintolin players:
            <strong>Buttercup</strong> and <strong>Miko</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The third version was rewritten from scratch by another player: <strong>Ecce</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            This is the fourth version, also created by one of the players: <strong>Badziew</strong>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What language is Shintolin coded in?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Shintolin was originally written in PHP, with a MySQL database.</li>
          <li>For version 2, the game engine was rewritten in Ruby.</li>
          <li>
            For version 3, the game engine was rewritten in Node.js (JavaScript & CoffeeScript),
            with a MongoDB database.
          </li>
          <li>For version 4, the game engine was rewritten in modern PHP, with a PostgreSQL database.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What games is Shintolin based on?</h3>
        <p>
          Shintolin owes many of its game mechanics to <a href="https://www.urbandead.com/" rel="external"
          >Urban Dead</a>, which features grid-based gameplay and an AP system, and is set in a quarantined city during
          a zombie apocalypse. There are several browser games based on Urban Dead; of all of them, Shintolin probably
          shares the most similarities with <a href="https://www.shartak.com/" rel="external">Shartak</a>,
          which is about life on a mysterious tropical island.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the features of settlements are based on strategy games,
          such as <em>Civilisation</em> and <em>Stronghold</em>.
        </p>

        <h3>I have some cool ideas for the game!</h3>
        <p>
          <del>
            Post them on the suggestions section of the forums – I try to look at all well-thought-out ideas.
            Also, be sure to comment on other people’s suggestions; it’s a big help when designing to have different
            points of view to read.
          </del>
        </p>
        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> the forums are gone, so the ideas should be posted on Discord or Reddit.</p>
